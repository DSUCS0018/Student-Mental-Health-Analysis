# Student Mental Health Analysis

This project analyzes student mental health data by focusing on various factors like study hours, sleep patterns, anxiety, depression, and extracurricular involvement. The goal is to explore the relationship between mental health and academic performance using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset and prepare it for modeling. After preprocessing the data, I applied two different machine learning algorithms:

- **Support Vector Classification (SVC)**: A powerful classifier used for predicting anxiety and depression levels.
- **Random Forest (RF)**: A robust ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.

I compared the performance of both models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² for regression.

### Features:
- **Student_ID**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Age**: The student's age.
- **Gender**: Gender of the student.
- **Study_Hours**: Number of hours spent studying per day.
- **Sleep_Hours**: Number of hours spent sleeping per day.
- **Anxiety_Level**: Anxiety level on a scale from 1 to 10.
- **Depression_Level**: Depression level on a scale from 1 to 10.
- **Extracurricular**: Participation in extracurricular activities (Yes/No).
- **Performance_Level**: Academic performance (Low, Medium, High).
